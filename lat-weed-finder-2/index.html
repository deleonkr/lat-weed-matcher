	<!-- TEXT SECTION -->
	<div id="text-container" class="align-content">

		<p><span class="dropcap">W</span>hen looking for the type of weed you want versus the weed you need, finding a place to start can be a little confusing. After all, there are over 770 known variants of cannabis, and they can be used for recreational or medical purposes. Whether it's physical, mental or health-related, there's probably some type of marijuana that can cater to your needs.</p>

		<p>The marijuana plant can produce several different chemical compounds, but one, in particular, can get people high. Tetrahydrocannabinol, more commonly known by its acronym THC, is one of more than <a href="https://hightimes.com/health/science/thc-tetrahydrocannabinol/">100 chemical compounds</a> within the Cannabis plant genus. When one consumes cannabis, THC will often activate a physiological and psychological response. Every person&rsquo;s high is unique, and there are many factors that can contribute to your high including the percentage of THC in your weed.</p>
		<p>Another common chemical is Cannabidiol or CBD. CBD is <a href="https://hightimes.com/health/cannabidiol-cbd/">not psychoactive</a> and does not typically get people high. So if you&rsquo;re not interested in getting all stoney baloney but still need some pain relief, perhaps try eating food or putting on lotion containing CBD. In 2015, the National Institute on Drug Abuse <a href="https://www.drugabuse.gov/about-nida/legislative-activities/testimony-to-congress/2016/biology-potential-therapeutic-effects-cannabidiol">found that CBD</a> has a wide range of what they call positive effects, such as reducing the severity of seizures, decreasing tumor growths and reducing anxiety and post-traumatic stress.</p>
		<p>Brandon Morales, a budtender of a small recreational club in Oakland, Calif., says that he recommends using CBD for similar effects. &ldquo;In my opinion, I would recommend people with nerve pain, muscle pains [or] spasms, or epilepsy should highly look into CBD,&rdquo; Morales says.</p>
		<p>Morales tests every strain of marijuana in his club, and he says that different strains have different effects on the body. But some believe that marijuana strains doesn&rsquo;t exist, like Jahan Marcu, Chief Science Officer for Americans for Safe Access.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;That's a made up term by the industry,&rdquo; Marcu said, &ldquo;you have 'chemical varieties' of marijuana.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>Morales agrees from a scientific standpoint, but when it comes to the plant itself, he says he isn&rsquo;t too sure.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;There are male and female versions of these plants, that's how natural growers breed these different, new and more potent varieties of this plant,&rdquo; Morales said, &ldquo;And by definition, isn't that exactly what the word &lsquo;strain&rsquo; means.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>So what does &ldquo;strain&rdquo; mean?</p>
		<p>Sativa, indica and hybrid are labels given to various marijuana strains that predict the effect on a person based on the strains&rsquo; chemical profile. Morales says that strains classified as sativa are will give your an &ldquo;energy or cerebral boost&rdquo; that prompting more energizing or focusing effects. He also says indica strains are the polar opposite &mdash; they&rsquo;ve been known to make consumers more sleepy and relaxed, while hybrid strains are a combination of the two.</p>
		<p>In Morales&rsquo; budtending experience, most people look for a combination of indica-dominant hybrid. &ldquo;They usually go that route because they are looking for that relaxed, euphoric feel,&rdquo; Morales said, &ldquo;But [they] do not want something that will make them too sleepy.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>However, Leafly <a href="https://www.leafly.com/news/cannabis-101/sativa-indica-and-hybrid-differences-between-cannabis-types">suggests</a> that consumers should not get caught up in the labels and should instead examine the THC and CBD levels when looking for a particular experience. Strains high in THC can give consumers a more euphoric experience, while strains higher in CBD offer more symptom relief without cloudiness. Balanced THC/CBD strains exhibit a little bit of both qualities, providing symptom relief with a mild high. These are mere guidelines; each user&rsquo;s experience may be different.</p>

	<!-- Methodology -->
	<h2 id="methods">METHODOLOGY</h2>
	<p>The data comes from <a href="http://api.kushy.net/">Kushy App</a>, a collection of data from different sectors of the industry that tests for things like strains and lab results. </p>
	
	<p>Kushy is a free app where users can find pretty much any information having to do with the cannabis industry from jobs to learning about equipment to grow marijuana. The app also provides users with a directory of nearby dispensaries and delivery services as well as information about specific strains. The app is available for both iPhone and Android users.</p>
	
	<p>We used <a href="https://github.com/kushyapp/cannabis-dataset">this dataset</a> that was scraped from Kushy. To clean up the data, we removed all columns except for name, strain, mood, flavor, and THC and CBD percentages. There were originally 10-12 moods in the dataset, so we scaled down the moods to list just five to ensure the interactive would be more user-friendly. This was done for both recreational and medical data. </p>
	
	<p>After the data was cleaned, we removed all rows that were not completely filled out to ensure it would work with the interactive&rsquo;s code. After that, each strain, mood and flavor was separated by column and filled out with a series of zeros (0s) and ones (1s). Zeros indicated that the strain, mood or flavor was false, while ones indicated that it was true. </p>
