	<!-- TEXT SECTION -->
	<div id="text-container" class="align-content">

		<p><span class="dropcap">W</span>hen looking for the type of weed you want versus the weed you need, finding a place to start can be a little confusing. After all, there are over 770 known variants of cannabis, and they can be used for recreational or medical purposes. Whether it's physical, mental or health-related, there's probably some type of marijuana that can cater to your needs.</p>

		<p>The marijuana plant can produce several different chemical compounds, but one, in particular, can get people high. Tetrahydrocannabinol, more commonly known by its acronym THC, is one of more than 100 chemical compounds within the Cannabis plant genus. When one consumes cannabis, THC will often activate a physiological and psychological response. Every person's high is unique, and there are many factors that can contribute to your high including the percentage of THC in your weed.</p>

		<p>Another common chemical is Cannabidiol or CBD. CBD is not psychoactive and does not typically get people high. So if you're not interested in getting all stoney baloney, perhaps try eating food or putting on lotion containing CBD. <em>[Insert quote here from dispensary owner about CBD]</em> In 2015, the National Institute on Drug Abuse study found that CBD has a wide range of positive effects, including reducing the severity of seizures, decreasing tumor growths and reducing anxiety and post-traumatic stress.</p>

		<p>Now for the glossary terms.</p>

		<p>Sativa, indica and hybrid are labels given to various marijuana strains that predict the effect on a person based on the strains' chemical profile. Strains classified as sativa are generally "uppers,"" prompting more energizing effects. Indica strains have been known to make consumers more sleepy, and lastly, hybrid strains are a combination of the two.</p>

		<p>However, Leafly <a href="https://www.leafly.com/news/cannabis-101/sativa-indica-and-hybrid-differences-between-cannabis-types">suggests</a> that consumers should not get caught up in the labels and should instead examine the THC and CBD levels when looking for a particular experience. Strains high in THC can give consumers a more euphoric experience, while strains higher in CBD offer more symptom relief without cloudiness. Balanced THC/CBD strains exhibit a little bit of both qualities, providing symptom relief with a mild high. These are mere guidelines; each user's experience may be different.</p>

		<h2 class="text-subhead">How are you looking to consume your marijuana?</h2>

		<p>There are three primary ways: inhalation, orally or topically.</p>

		<p>Inhalation is the fastest way to receive the effects of marijuana, because once inhaled, the cannabinoids enter the lungs and then travel to and throughout the bloodstream. Inhalation also makes overconsumption less likely for consumers. The two ways to inhale marijuana are via smoking and vaporizing. Mechanically, consumers can smoke in a variety of different fashions including rolling up a joint or blunt, via a pipe or bong and even through a carved fruit, like an apple. Smoking involves burning the marijuana flowers and inhaling the active component released.</p>

		<p>While vaporization is similar, the flowers are not burning and instead heated to a point at which the ingredient are released into a vapor that is then inhaled. This process is often looked at as being healthier, because there is less throat and lung irritation from the absence of the burning marijuana flowers.</p>

		<p>Marijuana can also be ingested orally via edibles, cannabis-infused drinks or even capsules and oils. Edibles are typically baked goods or candy that were made with marijuana. Oral ingestion reaches has a slower matriculation rate to the bloodstream; however, the effects can be stronger and last longer. The high lasts longer, because the cannabinoids ingested sustain a chemical transformation that makes them stronger.</p>

		<p>Consumers can also get high from using topical lotions or bath bombs infused with THC. The cannabinoids reach the bloodstream through skin absorption. Those who use this method are typically looking for pain relief within a specific area of the body.</p>

		<p>Disclaimer: The following interactive can be used to help you figure out what strain of weed you should smoke for your desired effect, and these effects will differ for every person. The data comes from Kushy, a collection of data from different sectors of the industry, that tests for things like strains and lab results.
